### How do same-sex couples affect central cities?
In the United States, same-sex couples disproportionately live in central cities of Metropolitan Statistical Areas, and their presence has often been reported as an indicator of imminent gentrification. In this paper, I suggest three mechanisms that attract same-sex couples into central cities: higher average income, lower tendency to have children, and greater preferences for cultural tolerance. Analysis based on American Community Survey data provides evidence for these mechanisms. Further analysis using a shift-share IV shows that the initial share of same-sex couples downtown increases the economic growth of downtown.
